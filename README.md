## FINAL EXAM HINTS

• Table Definition: A table in SQL Server is a structured set of data held in a database.

• Primary Key Characteristics: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table.

• Foreign Key Purpose: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables.

• Creating Tables Command: Use the `CREATE TABLE` command to define a new table.

• LEFT JOIN Functionality: A LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right.

• View Definition: A view in SQL Server is a virtual table created by a query.

• Scalar vs. Aggregate Functions: Scalar functions return a single value; aggregate functions return summarized values from multiple records.

• INNER JOIN Results: INNER JOIN returns records with matching values in both tables.

• Removing Tables Command: Use `DROP TABLE` to remove a table from a database.

• Function Purpose: Functions in SQL Server can perform actions on data and return a single value or a table.

• FULL OUTER JOIN Use: FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

• WHERE Clause Function: The WHERE clause filters records based on specified conditions.

• Updating Records Command: Use the `UPDATE` command to modify existing records in a table.

• DISTINCT Keyword Use: The DISTINCT keyword returns only unique records in a query result.

• Types of Relationships: Common relationships include One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many; Few-to-Many is not standard.

• Normalization Importance: Normalization reduces redundancy and improves data integrity.

• Indexes: Indexes improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval.

• SQL Data Types: Familiarize yourself with common data types like INT, VARCHAR, and DATE.

• Aggregate Functions: Examples include COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().

• Subqueries: Understand how to use subqueries to retrieve data based on the results of another query.

Good luck everyone !
